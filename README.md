# FastScanLP
 Fast TCP scan 

 Usage: ./FastScanLP.sh < -H <IP> | -D <DNS> > [-l]

 Without -l you have a list with an open port in each line. With -l, the list is just numeric and in one line (more "grepeable" i think)

 The DNS resolver will be ready soon (still not working)

 Thanks for using the Scanner!! Please be free to want stuff


 # How it works?

 This scanner works fast doing TCP requests without retries to the address you need.
 The only information you will have is which ports are open.
